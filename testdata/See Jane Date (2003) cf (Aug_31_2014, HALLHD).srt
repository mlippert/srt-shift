    OF HOOTERS AIR.             

116
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,304
MY DATING DAYS                  
ARE OVER.                       

117
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,939
WHAT DATING DAYS?               
YOU HAD ONE DATE.               

118
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,507
YEAH, AND THE LESSON            
WE LEARNED                      

119
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,509
IS THAT IT WAS                  
TOO SOON.                       

120
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,044
HON, YOU AND MAX                
BROKE UP A YEAR AGO.            

121
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,313
OH! AND THE FORMULA SAYS        
IT DOES TAKE HALF THE TIME      

122
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,181
A COUPLE WAS TOGETHER           
TO GET OVER THE BREAKUP.        

123
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,850
SO CONSIDERING YOU WENT OUT     
FOR 2 YEARS                     

124
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,618
AND BROKE UP                    
A YEAR AGO,                     

125
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,086
YOU SHOULD BE OUT THERE,        
JANE, HAVING FUN.               

126
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,855
"FUN" IS NOT HOW                
I WOULD DESCRIBE BEING SET UP   

127
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:51,757
WITH ALL THE OTHER LOSERS       
WHO CAN'T GET DATES.            

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,958
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.           

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,159
OH, BUT IT IS.                  

130
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:56,128
YOU JUST DON'T REMEMBER         
BECAUSE YOU'RE MARRIED,         

131
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,496
AND YOU HAVE SERGE.             

132
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,531
DO YOU WANT SERGE?              
HE'S STARTING TO BUG ME.        

133
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,732
THIS IS HOT!

PORNOGRAPHY.                    

135
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,471
ALL RIGHT,                      
DON'T LET HER SET YOU UP.       

136
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,773
WHERE?                          

137

STILL NOT DATING,               

148
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,765
    AND SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT    
    REFERRING TO HERSELF        

149
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,966
      IN THE THIRD PERSON       
           ANYMORE.             

150
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,835
DID YOU HEAR ABOUT              
NATASHA NUTLEY?                 

151
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,870
SHE WAS THE GIRL WHO BEAT YOU

AND THE ONE WHO SQUASHED        
ALL OF MY SELF-ESTEEM           

154
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,310

 BACK INTO THIS DECADE.         

160
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,787
SO WHY DOES NATASHA NUTLEY      
GET A BIOGRAPHY?                

161

163
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,025
THE GNAT WAS IN                 
A COUPLE OF SOAPS,              

164
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,426
BUT HER BIG BREAK               

165
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:04,863
WAS A SMALL PART AS A FEMBOT    
IN<i> AUSTIN POWERS.</i>               

166
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,465
YOU CALL HER                    
"THE GNAT"?                     
WELL, NOT                       
TO HER FACE.

SHE CALLS HIM "THE ACTOR."      

177
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,453
HE MADE HER SIGN A DOCUMENT.    

178
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,489
AND IT SAYS IF SHE EVER         
DISCUSSED HIM BY NAME,          

179
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,157

THE DAY OF THE WEDDING.         

227
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,762
HOW DID YOU HAPPEN              
TO HEAR THAT?                   

228
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,898
I ASKED HIM!                    

229
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,833
WILLIAM WILL BE READY           
TO SEE YOU                      

230
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,369
IN EXACTLY ONE MINUTE.          

231
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,639
I'M SORRY, AUNT INA,            
I HAVE TO GO.                   

232
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,107
BYE FOR NOW, HONEY.             

233
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:34,913
OH, HEY, MAX.                   

234
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,448

TALK'S TODAY, RIGHT?            

235
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,149
I'M ON MY WAY RIGHT NOW.        

236
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,184
YOU'LL BE FINE.                 

237
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,619
I KNOW.                         

238
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,620
JUST BE CONFIDENT.              

239
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,888
I AM CONFIDENT.                 

240
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,022
YOU'RE SHAKING.                 

241
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,991
I KNOW--                        
I'M EXCITED!                    

242
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:46,758
WELL, GOOD LUCK.                

243
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,893
THANKS.                         

244
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,594
OH, AND DON'T DO THAT THING     

245
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,863
WHERE YOU MAKE STATEMENTS       
AS IF THEY'RE QUESTIONS.        

246
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,899
OK, WELL, YOU'RE NOT            
MY BOYFRIEND ANYMORE            

247
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,500
SO YOU DON'T GET TO             
BE THAT HONEST.                 

248
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,735
RIGHT.                          

249
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,503
THANKS.

253
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,551
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!             

254
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,885
[LAUGHS]                        

255
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,620
UM, I WANTED                    
TO TALK TO YOU                  

256
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,422
ABOUT MY FUTURE                 
HERE AT<i> BLUSH.</i>                  

257
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,091
AS YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN HERE     
FOR 6 YEARS NOW.                

258
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,661
MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW THAT       
'CAUSE YOU PROBABLY HAVE        

259
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:25,297
BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN        
KEEP TRACK OF MY EMPLOYMENT.    

260
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,232
ANYWAY, I WAS JUST THINKING     
THAT DURING THIS TIME           

261
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,700
I'VE DONE GOOD WORK,            

262
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,769
AND I THOUGHT THAT IT           
MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME     

263
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,837
TO MOVE INTO A POSITION         
OF MORE RESPONSIBILITY.         

264
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,340
       MORGAN, WHERE'S          
       THAT PRESS RELEASE ON

TAKE HER TO LUNCH TOMORROW.     
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER?       

280
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,800
THE BISTRO?                     
ASKING                          
OR TELLING, GRANT.

        AROUND HERE LATELY.     

283
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,138

286
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,545
THEN, MAYBE, WE'LL

287
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,414
ASSOCIATE EDITOR,

297
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,108

THAT WAS YOU!                   

298
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,709
DANA, HI.

299
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:47,245
OH, I'M HAVING A LUNCH MEETING  
WITH MY FABULOUS CATERER.       

300
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,180
HE WAS ON THE TEAM              
FOR IVANA'S THIRD WEDDING.      

301
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:52,083
OH, WIDELY CONSIDERED           
TO BE HER BEST.                 

302
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,386
YOU'RE NOT HAVING LUNCH ALONE,  
ARE YOU? THAT'S SO AWKWARD.     

303
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,620

A MILLION THINGS TO DO.         

306
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,292
IF YOU EVER GET MARRIED,        
YOU'LL SEE. [LAUGHS]            

307
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,200

WOW, I JUST CAN'T               
GET OVER IT!                    

311
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:19,911

312
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,746
I MEAN, WHO WOULD OF THOUGHT    
WE'D BE WORKING TOGETHER?       

313
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,314
CERTAINLY NOT ME.               

314
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,116
AND YOU JUST LOOK ADORABLE!     

315
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,752
WELL, YOU LOOK GREAT, TOO,      
AS ALWAYS.                      

316
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,654
    WELL, WE HAVE               
    A LOT TO COVER,             

317
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,389
SO I THOUGHT                    
WE'D JUMP RIGHT IN.             

318
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,224
UM, I WAS LOOKING OVER          
YOUR PROPOSAL                   

319
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,959
AND I NOTICED YOU WENT WITH     
A CHRONOLOGICAL STRUCTURE.      

320
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,996
OH, JANEY, COME ON!             
ALL BUSINESS?                   

321
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,198
    WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER  
        IN, LIKE, 10 YEARS!     

322
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
        I MEAN, I WAS SHOCKED   
        WHEN I HEARD MY EDITOR  

323
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:45,003
            WAS GONNA BE

325
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,940
OH, REALLY? WHERE?

UM, SOME HIGH-TECH              
WATER DRINK.                    

564
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,152
OH, WELL, MAYBE THIS            
WILL BE A SPRINGBOARD           

565
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,254
TO ONE OF THOSE                 
MILK MOUSTACHE CAMPAIGNS.       

566
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:24,555
YOU THINK?                      
YEAH!                           

567
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,590
[BOTH LAUGH]                    

568
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,625
SO, UH, UM--                    
OH, NO, HONEY!                  

569
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:30,795
    SEE, YOU HAVE TO SCRAPE     
    THE BAGEL GUTS OUT--        

570
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,430
IT SHOULD BE A SHELL.           

571
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,932
[LAUGHS]                        

572
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,634
OK, HERE'S                      
WHAT I WAS THINKING--           

573
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:38,402
WE'LL START TODAY               
PUTTING TOGETHER                

574
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,738
A REALLY SUPER-DETAILED OUTLINE 
OF THE FIRST CHAPTER            

575
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,306
SO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY            
START THE WRITING,              

576
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,774
EVERYTHING WILL                 
PRACTICALLY BE DONE.            

577
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,244
OH, WELL,                       
YOU CAN STOP WORRYING           
ABOUT THE FIRST CHAPTER         

578
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,347
BECAUSE AFTER OUR LUNCH         
I WAS SO INSPIRED               

579
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,415
THAT I JUST WENT AHEAD          
AND I STARTED WRITING.          

580
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,117
I WROTE AND WROTE               
ALL NIGHT LONG.                 

581
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,485
                    YOU DID?    
    SO,                         

582
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:56,187
    CAN I READ YOU              
    WHAT I HAVE SO FAR?         

583
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:57,588
    YES.                        

584
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,758
    "I WAS IN                   
    THE MIDDLE OF...            

585
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,294
"ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ACTORS  
    IN SHOW BUSINESS            

586
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:08,899
    WHEN HE HANDED ME           
    A LEGAL DOCUMENT TO SIGN."  

587
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,201
    THAT'S IT!                  

588
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:12,003
WELL, I FIGURED THE FIRST       
SENTENCE WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT,

589
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,171
SO I WANTED TO SPEND            
A LONG TIME ON IT.              

590
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,640
           OK, WELL,            

591
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,441
THE REST OF THE CHAPTER'S       
GONNA BE A LOT OF WORK.         

592
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,343
YOU KNOW, FRIDAY'S ONLY         
A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY.          

593
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,078
WAIT--THIS FRIDAY?              
                YES.            

594
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,114
         OH, I THOUGHT YOU MEANT
         NEXT FRIDAY.           

595
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,049
             NO, NO--           
             I SAID THIS FRIDAY.

596
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,384
                WOW, WELL,      

597
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:28,452
     I GUESS WE'RE JUST GONNA   
     HAVE TO JUMP RIGHT IN THEN.

598
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,321
    OH, GOOD, OK!               
    NATASHA, WE'RE              
    READY FOR YOU.              

599
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,290
    OOPS!                       
    BREAK'S OVER.               

600
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,192
            OK, I'M ONLY GOOD   
            FOR ANOTHER HOUR.   

601
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:41,832
GRAY SHIRT AND JEANS.           

602
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,736
GRAY SHIRT AND JEANS.           

603
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,073
GRAY SHIRT AND JEANS.           

604
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,345
ARE YOU JANE?                   
[GASPS]                         
YEAH.                           

605
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,646
YOU WALKED RIGHT BY ME.         

606
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,915
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA   
WEAR A GRAY SHIRT AND JEANS.    

607
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,451
OH, WELL.                       

608
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,153
OH, I SEE WHAT'S                
GOING ON HERE--                 

609
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,154
THE OLD GETAWAY OUTFIT.         

610
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,188
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?               

611
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,790
YOU KNOW,                       
JUST THAT IF YOU SAW ME         

612
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,692
AND YOU DIDN'T WANT             
THE DATE TO HAPPEN,             

613
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:11,162
YOU COULD KIND OF               
[SWISH] ESCAPE.                 

614
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,963
SURE.                           
UH, I'LL HAVE A BEER.           

615
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,231
2 PINTS.                        

616
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,766
OH, AND 2 WATERS,               
PLEASE.                         

617
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,702
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME              
THE WATER.                      

618
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,703
I JUST THOUGHT OF IT.           

619
00:22:18,705 --> 00:22:20,237
I JUST DON'T WANT TO            
BE JUDGED BY YOU                

620
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:21,672
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK          
OF THE WATER THING.             

621
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,207
NO JUDGING--                    
I SWEAR.                        

622
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,443
I'M SORRY, I'M PROBABLY         
A LITTLE SENSITIVE.             

623
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:26,977
MY EX, KAREN, GOD--             

624
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,779
I COULD NEVER DO ANYTHING       
RIGHT WITH HER.                 

625
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,348
I WAS ALWAYS                    
SECOND-GUESSING.                

626
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,717
SO YOU MUST'VE BEEN RELIEVED    
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO MOVE ON.    

627
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,518
YEAH, NOT REALLY--              
SHE DUMPED ME.                  

628
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,953
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU              
GONNA DO?                       

629
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,321
EXCEPT GO OUT AND TRY           
TO MEET NEW PEOPLE...           

630
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:39,590
WHO ARE PROBABLY GOING TO DO    
THE SAME THING TO YOU.          

631
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,859
TO BETTER SITUATIONS.           

632
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:44,995
YOU KNOW,                       
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,        

633
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:47,031
I JUST WENT THROUGH A BREAKUP   
MYSELF NOT TOO LONG AGO,        

634
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,699
AND I KNOW HOW PAINFUL          
IT CAN BE.                      

635
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,668
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE TRYING     
TO BE HELPFUL,                  

636
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,103
AND THEY'RE JUST                
PUSHING YOU INTO DATES          

637
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,671
WHEN REALLY ALL YOU NEED        
TO DO IS JUST KINDA             

638
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,773
WORK THROUGH THINGS YOURSELF    
AT YOUR OWN PACE.               

639
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,274
RIGHT.                          

640
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,676
I'M SORRY--                     

641
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,611
ARE YOU SIGNALING               
TO SOMEONE?                     

642
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:02,513
WHAT?                           

643
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:05,015
IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE HAVING SOME
KIND OF SECRET CONVERSATION.    

644
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,384
UH, YEAH.                       

645
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,552
THAT'S--THAT'S                  
MY FRIEND RICK.                 

646
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,023
WELL, S-SHOULD                  
YOU GO SAY HI?                  

647
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:13,591
OH, NO,                         
WE CAME TOGETHER.               

648
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,059
EVER SINCE KAREN,               

649
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,827
I DON'T REALLY TRUST MYSELF     
TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES.           

650
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,462
I NEEDED                        
A SECOND OPINION.               

651
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:20,064
OK, WELL, THEN,                 

652
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,133
WHY DON'T WE JUST PRETEND       
HE'S NOT THERE THEN?            

653
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,935
YEAH, HE DOESN'T THINK          
THIS IS GOING ANYWHERE.         

654
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,303
EXCUSE ME?!                     

655
00:23:26,305 --> 00:23:28,205
HE SENSES YOU MIGHT BE          
A LITTLE NEEDY                  

656
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,673
AND NOT REALLY                  
OVER YOUR EX.                   

657
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,675
WELL, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY       
GO AHEAD AND GO THEN.           

658
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,310
NO HARD FEELINGS.               

659
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,312
ACTUALLY, I'D KIND OF LIKE      
TO HAVE A BEER WITH RICK.       

660
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,781
MAYBE YOU COULD LEAVE.          

661
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,516
    RIGHT.                      

662
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,521
HE'S ALL YOURS.                 

663
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,094
Jane:                           
AW, POOR JOANNA CRUM.           

664
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,295
    Eloise: WHY?                

665
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,863
SHE COULDN'T GET HER SCHLUB     
OF A FIANCé TO POSE             

666
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,632
IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT PHOTO       
WITH HER.                       

667
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,467
YEAH, THAT MARRIAGE             
IS GONNA LAST.                  

668
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,402
SHE'S 26.                       

669
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,704
AND WHAT--OLD MAID?             
GOTTA TAKE WHAT SHE CAN GET?    

670
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,340
NO! IT'S JUST,                  
AS PEOPLE GET OLDER,            

671
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,608
THEY'RE MORE WILLING            
TO OVERLOOK THINGS              

672
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,210
IN THE INTEREST                 
OF FINDING SOMEONE.             

673
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,845
CODE FOR "LOWER                 
YOUR STANDARDS."                

674
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,113
NO, IT'S NOT LOWERING--         

675
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,848
IT'S DEFINITELY REASSESSING     
YOUR PRIORITIES.                

676
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,149
YOU KNOW, FOR INSTANCE,         

677
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,518
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I'D END UP     
WITH SOMEONE ATHLETIC.          

678
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,353
AND AT 20,                      
I CAN HOLD OUT FOR THAT.        

679
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:18,122
COMING UP ON 30, YEAH,          

680
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,691
I'M OK WITH THE FACT THAT ALL   
JEFF PLAYS IS THE CLARINET.     

681
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:22,593
HEY, SHOULDN'T YOU BE READING   
THE GNAT'S FIRST CHAPTER?       

682
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:24,829
I SHOULD, EXCEPT SHE HASN'T     
GIVEN IT TO ME YET.             

683
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,263
SHE MISSED HER                  
FAKE DEADLINE.                  

684
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,132
LOOK HOW SMART I WAS            
TO ASSUME SHE'D FLAKE.          

685
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,934
WELL, I HAVE TILL NEXT WEEK     
TO GET IT FROM HER, SO--        

686
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:31,168
AH, SHE PROBABLY GOT COCKY      

687
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,636
BECAUSE WHAT YOU SAID           
SHE DID WAS GOOD.               

688
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,473
NICE WORD CHOICE.               

689
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:36,540
            BLIND DATE HOTLINE! 

690
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:38,375
HELLO?                          
HI, JANE?                       

691
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:39,977
THIS IS HANK CHILTON--          
JEFF'S FRIEND.                  

692
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,011
OH, HI, HANK.                   

693
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,380
OH, GOOD-LOOKING,               
ASSERTIVE, SUPER-SMART.         

694
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,715
I WAS, UH, WONDERING            

695
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:46,250
IF YOU WERE FREE FOR DINNER     
ON SATURDAY.                    

696
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:48,185
I AM FREE FOR DINNER            
ON SATURDAY.                    

697
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,920
NO! YOU NEVER ADMIT             
YOU'RE FREE ON SATURDAY!        

698
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,656
GREAT. WHY DON'T WE MEET        
AT 9:00 AT NATE'S?              

699
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,892
I'LL BE THE TALL ONE            
WITH DARK HAIR, GREEN EYES,     

700
00:24:54,894 --> 00:24:56,994
AND A REALLY                    
NERVOUS EXPRESSION.             

701
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,797
[LAUGHS] OK,                    
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.              

702
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,365
THAT GIVES US A WEEK            
TO FIGURE OUT                   

703
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,633
HOW WE'RE GONNA                 
PACKAGE YOU.                    

704
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:04,168
WE STILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT     
THE DINNER PARTY, TOO.          

705
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,237
OH, RIGHT--                     
YOGA GUY'S FRIEND!              

706
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:08,873
I'M THINKING SHE SHOULD WEAR    
SOMETHING FLOWY, YOU KNOW?      

707
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,808
MAYBE YOU CAN READ UP           
ON HOLISTIC MEDICINE.           

708
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,477
HERE'S A CRAZY THOUGHT,         
BUT WHAT IF I JUST GO AS I AM?  

709
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,113
Both:                           
THE WEDDING'S IN 3 WEEKS.       

710
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,015
EXCUSE ME--                     
I DIDN'T MEAN TO EAVESDROP,     

711
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,917
BUT WHEN YOU TALK ON YOUR       
CELLPHONE IN A PUBLIC PLACE,    

712
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,085
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.            

713
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,520
WILL YOU PEOPLE FIND            
A NEW SCAPEGOAT?                

714
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,255
GET THE SMOKERS                 
BACK IN HERE.                   

715
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,489
I WAS KIDDING!                  

716
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,091
I KNEW SHE WAS                  
SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT,        

717
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:28,792
SO I WENT FOR THE EASY JOKE.    

718
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:31,462
WHICH, NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT   
IT, WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA.    

719
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:33,364
LET ME START AGAIN--            
I'M GARY.                       

720
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,432
SHE'S JANE.                     
DOESN'T MATTER WHO WE ARE.      

721
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:38,269
OH, WELL, I'M A COORDINATOR     
FOR CITY-CARE.                  

722
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,271
WE DO ALL SORTS OF              
VOLUNTEER WORK, AND--           

723
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:41,539
JANE LOVES                      
VOLUNTEER WORK.                 

724
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:43,173
WELL, WE'RE STARTING UP         

725
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,942
THIS NEW MONTHLY ACTIVITY       
      FOR SINGLES--             

726
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,677
    KIND OF A SELF-SERVING      
        PUBLIC SERVICE.         

727
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,245
    I DON'T KNOW                
    YOUR SITUATION--            

728
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,281
SHE'S SINGLE.                   

729
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:53,050
YES, APPARENTLY I LEFT          
MY SCARLET "S" AT HOME.         

730
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,452
WELL, THIS SATURDAY             
WE'RE CLEANING UP THE PARK--    

731
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:56,987
EXCEPT FOR THE REALLY           
DISGUSTING THINGS,              

732
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,355
BECAUSE WE'RE ONLY VOLUNTEERS.  

733
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,857
ANYWAY, IT WOULD BE GREAT       
TO SEE YOU.                     

734
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,191
SHE'LL BE THERE.                

735
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,826
UH, CAN SHE GET                 
YOUR NUMBER?                    

736
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,697
SURE.                           

737
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,900
CALL ME ANY TIME                
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.         

738
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,235
JUST DON'T CALL ME              
ON YOUR CELLPHONE.              

739
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,369
[LAUGHS]                        

740
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,672
    NOW, SEE, WHY DID I HAVE    
    TO GO BACK TO THAT?         

741
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:18,342
I'M LEAVING                     
BEFORE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.    

742
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:19,910
OH, HAPPILY MARRIED,            

743
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,546
HAPPILY MARRIED,                
HAPPILY MARRIED.                

744
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,615
Jane: WE'RE LATE.               
WE HAVE WINE AND FLOWERS        
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.              

745
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,983
YEAH, BUT WE                    
WOULDN'T BE LATE                

746
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:27,651
IF WE HADN'T STOPPED            
FOR THE WINE AND FLOWERS.       

747
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,787
AH, THE CLASSIC                 
DINNER PARTY DILEMMA.           

748
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,256
        OK. HERE WE GO.         

749
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:34,892
[DOORBELL RINGS]                

750
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:38,329
HEY, EL.                        
[SMOOCHES]                      

751
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:39,930
THANK YOU,                      
WOW--HI.                        

752
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,332
HI.                             
I'M NOAH.                       

753
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:43,100
JANE.                           
COME ON IN.                     

754
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,668
Jane: THANKS FOR                
DOING THIS.                     

755
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,737
I ALWAYS FEEL BADLY             
WHEN MY DATING LIFE             

756
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,806
STARTS TO AFFECT THE LIVES      
OF INNOCENT BYSTANDERS.         

757
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,741
YEAH, WELL, UH,                 
UNFORTUNATELY,                  

758
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,476
THERE'S SOMETHING               
I NEED TO TELL YOU.             

759
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,145
UH, [CLEARS THROAT]             
GRANT GOT HERE EARLY            

760
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,581
AND I MAY HAVE MENTIONED        
THAT THIS IS A SET-UP.          

761
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,716
NOAH...                         

762
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,651
HE WAS DRESSED ALL WRONG,       
I HAD NO CHOICE.                

763
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,653
ANYWAY, HE'S BEEN GETTING       
MORE AND MORE NERVOUS,          

764
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:05,522
SO HE'S NOT                     
IN THE BEST SHAPE.              

765
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,824
OK.                             

766
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,759
JANE, UH, WOULD YOU LIKE        
TO HAVE SOME APPETIZERS         

767
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,395
WITH GRANT                      
IN THE LIVING ROOM?             

768
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:14,999
AND, EL, UH, WILLOW AND I COULD 
USE SOME HELP IN THE KITCHEN.   

769
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,367
THANK YOU.                      

770
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,972
HI, UH,                         
I'M JANE GRANT.                 

771
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,140
I'M--I'M GRANT.                 

772
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,541
HI, NICE                        
TO MEET YOU, GRANT.             

773
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,043
YOU CAN'T                       
BE GRANT.                       
I'M JANE.                       

774
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,445
SO WHY'D YOU SAY                
YOUR NAME WAS GRANT?            
GRANT'S MY LAST NAME.           

775
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:30,514
[Laughing]                      
OH, THAT'S PRETTY FUNNY.        
I GUESS.                        

776
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,149
WE'RE BOTH GRANTS.              
RIGHT.                          

777
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,351
IF WE GOT MARRIED, YOU KNOW,    
YOUR NAME WOULD BE GRANT GRANT. 

778
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,086
NO, IT WOULD                    
STILL BE JANE.                  

779
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,355
MMM, MMM--                      

780
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:41,492
OH, OH, I GET IT, I GET IT.     
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE WOMEN.      

781
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,460
MY FIRST NAME'S JANE,           

782
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:46,196
SO THAT WOULDN'T CHANGE         
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENED     

783
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:48,465
TO MY LAST NAME,                
WHICH IS GRANT.                 

784
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,234
YOU'RE PRETTY FUNNY

00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:58,689

I'VE NEVER MET HIM              

876

"OH, HEY,

DEVELOP A LEVEL OF COMFORT      

896
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:47,604
WHERE I COULD ASK HIM,

TO TELL MOM

WHY DON'T YOU TRY               
BLASTING GUNS N' ROSES          
INTO HER MACHINE                

1024
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:57,681
UNTIL SHE CAN'T BEAR IT         
ANYMORE AND IS FORCED           
TO COME OUT OF HIDING?          

1025
00:36:57,683 --> 00:37:00,450
HMM, THE NORIEGA                
APPROACH.                       

1026
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,953
OR YOU COULD FORGET             
HER AND JUST WRITE              
THE MEMOIRS YOURSELF.           

1027
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:06,056
AH, FIRST CHAPTER--             
"WHO AM I SLEEPING WITH TODAY?" 

1028
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:09,092
"WELL, IT'S TUESDAY--           
IT MUST BE A CASTING DIRECTOR." 

1029
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,194
"AND THEN IF I GET THE PART,    
IT'S MY LEADING MAN,            

1030
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,196
MY DIRECTOR, AND THE KID        
WHO BRINGS ME COFFEE."          

1031
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:15,932
"OH, ONLY IF IT'S               
THE STUDIO HEAD'S KID."         

1032
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,335
SO, SERIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENS     
IF SHE DOESN'T TURN UP?         

1033
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,470
I'VE SCOPED OUT A FEW PLACES

DANA AND THE GNAT THINK

THEY'RE BETTER                  
THAN YOU JUST 'CAUSE            
THEY HAVE BOYFRIENDS?           

1049
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,499
            NO. BUT DON'T       
            YOU THINK IT'S JUST 
            A LITTLE PATHETIC   

1050
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,801
TO BE DOING ALL THIS            
AT MY AGE?                      

1051
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,403
NO--IT'S                        
USUALLY PATHETIC.               

1052
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:55,305
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT--       
IT'S THEM.                      

1053
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:56,740
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO            
ONLY HAVE ONE MEASURE           

1054
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:58,642
FOR GAUGING WHETHER OR NOT      
A WOMAN IS A SUCCESS.           

1055
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:00,443
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.           

1056
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,012
SO YOU'RE GONNA BEAT THEM       
AT THEIR OWN GAME.              

1057
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:03,146
YEAH?

YOU ARE GONNA SHOW UP           
AT THAT WEDDING

HA HA!                          

1062
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:10,887

THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT           

1069
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,935

     THE ONLY OPTIONS ARE       

1103
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:44,881
    LOW-SODIUM SOY SAUCE        
        OR WATER.               

1104
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,349
WATER IS FINE.                  

1105
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:48,385
SO I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU     
IN A WHILE.                     

1106
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:52,355
       I'M ASSUMING THERE'S     
       BEEN SOME KIND OF        
       WRITER'S BLOCK GOING ON. 

1107
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:54,791
    FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,       
    I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT,   

1108
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:56,526
BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU            
IF YOU HIDE FROM ME.            

1109
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:58,061
I'M PREGNANT.                   

1110
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,764
WHAT DOES                       
YOUR BOYFRIEND SAY?             

1111
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:03,833
SAM'S...AMAZING.                

1112
00:40:03,835 --> 00:40:07,237
YOU KNOW, FIRST HE WAS          
A SAINT AFTER THE MESS          
WITH THE ACTOR,                 

1113
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,007
AND NOW THIS COMES ALONG,       
AND HE COULDN'T BE              
MORE THRILLED.                  

1114
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,442
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?       

1115
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:16,279
YEAH, IT IS.                    
I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL.           

1116
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,715
IT'S JUST THIS IS NOT           
WHAT I HAD PLANNED.             

1117
00:40:18,717 --> 00:40:20,083
YOU KNOW, NOT NOW.              

1118
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,918
NOT WHEN MY OWN LIFE            
IS SO SCREWED UP.               

1119
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,820
YOUR LIFE IS NOT SCREWED UP.    

1120
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:27,123
I AM A WASHED-UP ACTOR          
WHO'S ONLY KNOWN AT ALL         

1121
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:30,827
BECAUSE OF AN AFFAIR            
I HAD OVER A YEAR AGO           
WITH A REAL ACTOR.              

1122
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,695
YEAH, I'M DOING GREAT.          

1123
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,766
I DON'T KNOW THE FIRST THING    
ABOUT BEING A MOM.              

1124
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,901
WHAT IF I SCREW THAT UP TOO?    

1125
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,503
YOU WON'T.                      

1126
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:41,404
I DON'T.                        

1127
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:42,839
[LAUGHS]                        

1128
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,174
            BUT IF YOU DO SCREW 
                YOUR KID UP,    

1129
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:45,809
    THERE IS A WHOLE INDUSTRY   
    OF THERAPISTS OUT THERE     

1130
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,377
        THAT ARE JUST WAITING   
            TO HELP.            

1131
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:51,347
            EVERYONE SCREWS UP, 
            WHICH IS ACTUALLY   
            NORMAL, RIGHT?      

1132
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,982
NOT SCREWING UP WOULD BE        
THE WEIRD THING,                

1133
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,717
SO LET'S HOPE YOU               
SCREW UP, MISSY.                

1134
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,786
I'M SORRY FOR                   
THE DISAPPEARING ACT.           

1135
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:01,257
I JUST COULDN'T TALK            
TO ANYONE, BUT I DO HAVE        
THE FIRST CHAPTER.              

1136
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:04,828
        WOW, THAT'S AMAZING     
        CONSIDERING EVERYTHING  
        YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.    

1137
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,635
IS THIS IS IT?                  

1138
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,405
SHE'S GONNA GET FAT.            

1139
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:16,506
STOP IT.                        

1140
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,174
DO THEY MAKE LEATHER            
MATERNITY PANTS?                

1141
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,609
I ACTUALLY FEEL                 
KIND OF BAD FOR HER.            

1142
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:21,544
    OH, COME ON!                
SHE TOTALLY YOU OVER.           

1143
00:41:21,546 --> 00:41:23,213
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE       
A WEEK TO DO YOUR EXCERPT.      

1144
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:24,514
YOU HAD ONE NIGHT.              

1145
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:27,016
SO I'LL BILL HER FOR            
THE RED BULL I MAINLINED.       

1146
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:30,253
MORGAN, I NEED TO ORDER SOME    
OFFICE SUPPLIES, PLEASE.        

1147
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:32,922
        YEAH, YOU'VE EXCEEDED   
        YOUR MONTHLY LIMIT.     

1148
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,557
WE'VE CUT YOU OFF.              
       WHAT?                    

1149
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,026
            AND, UH, WILLIAM    
            WOULD LIKE TO SEE   
            YOU RIGHT AWAY.     

1150
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:38,495
OH, OK.                         

1151
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,129
        DON'T WORRY.            

1152
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,665
   NO ONE'S EVER BEEN FIRED     
   FOR USING TOO MANY POST-ITS, 

1153
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,133
AT LEAST NOT YET.               

1154
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:52,876
UH, HELLO.                      

1155
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:55,612
WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.         
SIT DOWN.                       

1156
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:07,123
I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
OK WITH THE NUTLEY PROJECT.     

1157
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,491
YES, AS FAR                     
AS I'M CONCERNED.               

1158
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:10,660
IT'S NOT ALWAYS SMOOTH EVERY    
STEP OF THE WAY,                

1159
00:42:10,662 --> 00:42:12,662
BUT AS LONG AS EVERYTHING       
      TURNS OUT OK,             

1160
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,764
WHO NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT         
THE PROBLEMS?                   

1161
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:20,470
WHICH PROBABLY                  
MAKES YOU WONDER WHY            
I BROUGHT THEM UP.              

1162
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:22,539
JANE'S DOING GREAT.             

1163
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,840
       I READ THE FIRST CHAPTER 
             THIS MORNING       

1164
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,275
            AND THE OUTLINE     
            FOR 2 AND 3,        

1165
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:27,277
AND IT'S RIGHT ON TRACK         
WITH WHAT WE WANT,              

1166
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:29,979
           AND THE EXCERPT FROM 
        <i> MARIE CLAIRE</i> --PERFECT.

1167
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,214
        IS THAT TRUE, GRANT?    

1168
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,049
        YES, I'M ACTUALLY       
        QUITE PLEASED           

1169
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,617
        WITH HOW EVERYTHING IS  
        TURNING OUT.            

1170
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,252
        WELL, SO AM I.          

1171
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,054
    REALLY?                     
        THAT'S WHY I SAID IT.   

1172
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,455
    OF COURSE.                  

1173
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:40,890
I WANT YOU TO WRITE             
THE BACK COVER COPY.            

1174
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,860
DO A GOOD JOB.                  
DO IT FAST.                     

1175
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:46,229
I WILL. THANK YOU.              

1176
00:42:47,766 --> 00:42:49,098
MAX, YOU STAY.                  

1177
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,134
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED        
TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.            

1178
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,742
SO...YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T THOUGHT 

1179
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,345
ABOUT ME AND MAX                
FOR A WHILE NOW.                

1180
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:03,479
UH-OH.                          

1181
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:05,815
I JUST GOT CALLED IN            
TO SEE REMKE                    

1182
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,717
AND AS USUAL I GOT              
COMPLETELY TONGUE-TIED,         

1183
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:09,452
BUT MAX STEPPED IN              
AND SAVED ME.                   

1184
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:13,523
HE RAVED ABOUT MY WORK, AND     
REMKE ENDED UP RAVING AS WELL.  

1185
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:14,591
JANE, THAT'S GREAT!             

1186
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,491
I KNOW.                         

1187
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:16,793
THAT'S ABOUT YOU, NOT MAX.      

1188
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:19,896
[SIGHS] WELL, IT'S JUST THAT    
HE KNOWS ME SO WELL,            

1189
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:22,565
AND HE MAKES ME FEEL...SAFE.    

1190
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:25,034
IT DIDN'T WORK                  
BETWEEN YOU GUYS.               

1191
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,936
        BUT IS IT WORKING       
        THAT MUCH BETTER NOW?   

1192
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,572
I MEAN ANY PROBLEMS WE HAD      
IN THE PAST SEEM PRETTY MINOR   

1193
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,107
COMPARED TO GUYS                
WITH GIRLFRIENDS,               

1194
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,976
AND GUYS WHO RUN OVER           
THEIR EXs,                      

1195
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,877
AND GUYS                        
WHO ARE DRIVEN TO DRINK         

1196
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,180
BY THE MERE THOUGHT             
OF DATING ME, AND--             

1197
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:38,247
YOU'RE IN THE TOAD PHASE.       

1198
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:39,482
IT'S JUST PART                  
OF MOVING FORWARD.              

1199
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:40,883
I DON'T KNOW.                   

1200
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:42,418
MOVING BACKWARDS TO SEE         
IF THINGS COULD WORK OUT        

1201
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,789
BETWEEN MAX AND I IS SOUNDING   
BETTER AND BETTER.              

1202
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,658
WELL, I DON'T WANT              
TO KEEP DATING!                 

1203
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,929
MY ONLY OTHER OPTION IS TO BUY  
A DOZEN CATS AND CALL IT A DAY. 

1204
00:43:52,931 --> 00:43:55,765
JANE, YOU'RE WANTED             
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.         

1205
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,067
YOU CAN COME TOO.               

1206
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:59,602
    THANKS.                     

1207
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,070
[LAUGHTER]                      

1208
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,839
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?            

1209
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:07,176
           I MEAN IT'S PROBABLY 
                INSANE, BUT...  

1210
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:09,612
          OH, MY GOD!           
          YOU'RE BEING PROMOTED!

1211
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:10,947
                MAYBE.          

1212
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,315
      THAT HAS TO BE IT.        
      YOU JUST SAID REMKE RAVED.

1213
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,783
              REMKE NEVER RAVES.

1214
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:17,153
I KNOW, AND HE ASKED MAX TO STAY
AFTER TO DISCUSS SOMETHING.     

1215
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,755
               IT'S ABOUT TIME!

THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS.         

1229
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:00,863
SHE'S NOT HERE, MAX.

1239
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:33,596
            YOU'RE EARLY.       
            SO ARE YOU.         

1240
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:36,065
    UH, I GUESS THAT'S ONE THING
    WE HAVE IN COMMON, HUH?     

1241
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,468
    I THOUGHT I WOULD SQUEEZE IN
    A LITTLE WORK.              

1242
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,470
           I DIDN'T MEAN FOR YOU
           TO CATCH ME. SORRY.  

1243
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:42,338
            OH, THAT'S OK.      
            I UNDERSTAND.       

1244
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,307
       IN FACT I SHOULDN'T ADMIT
       TO THIS,                 

1245
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,242
            BUT I BROUGHT SOME  
            OF MY WORK TOO      

1246
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,410
            IN CASE YOU ENDED UP
            BEING LATE.         

1247
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:50,480
            WOW!                

1248
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:52,648
   AND ALREADY WE'RE THE WORLD'S
   MOST BORING COUPLE.          

1249
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,751
       YEAH, WE MOVED RIGHT PAST
       BUTTERFLIES              

1250
00:45:54,753 --> 00:45:56,486
       INTO COMFORTABLY IGNORING
       EACH OTHER.              

1251
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:58,054
          I'M SORRY.            
          DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

1252
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,655
            [CHUCKLES]          

1253
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:02,725
   SO, UM, HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD
   THIS FEAR OF DOWNTIME?       

1254
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:06,262
   MMM. I TRACE IT BACK         
   TO A PIVOTAL SUBWAY BREAKDOWN

1255
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,563
            IN WHICH I HAD NO   
            READING MATERIALS.  

1256
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:09,098
      OH, THAT SOUNDS TRAUMATIC.

1257
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,367
          MM-HMM. IT ALTERED    
          THE COURSE OF MY LIFE.

1258
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:12,668
            WHAT ABOUT YOU?     

1259
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,304
    YEAH, 36 HOURS IN AN AIRPORT
    DURING A BLIZZARD.          

1260
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:16,739
            OUCH.               

1261
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:18,074
     MY STORY'S NOTHING COMPARED
     TO YOURS.                  

1262
00:46:18,076 --> 00:46:20,109
            WELL, THIS MAY SOUND
            A LITTLE WEIRD,     

1263
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,645
 BUT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP TONIGHT
 SHORT TO FINISH YOUR WORK,     

1264
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:23,846
         I'D TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

1265
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,281
           NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

1266
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:26,549
       I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
       TO MEETING YOU.

00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,286
            YEAH. WHY IS THAT   
            SO HARD TO BELIEVE? 

1269
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,355
     I'M JUST A LITTLE SURPRISED
     TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.        

1270
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:34,056
    NOBODY'S REALLY THAT DIRECT.

1271
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:36,259
      WELL, THEN IN THE INTEREST
      OF DIRECTNESS,            

1272
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:38,327
     I SHOULD PROBABLY TELL YOU

IS HE A GOOD KISSER?

        BECAUSE I HAD BEEN      
        FIRED FOR NOT GETTING   
        MY WORK DONE.           

1332
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:10,546
SHUTTING UP NOW.                

1333
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:11,881
HE'S A REALLY GOOD KISSER.      

1334
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:13,816
[CHUCKLES]                      

1335
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:21,257
HA HA HA!                       

1336
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:24,026
ALL RIGHT, I'LL ANSWER          
TO CATHERINE DeNEUVE,           
BRIGITTE BARDOT,                

1337
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:26,862
BUT I DRAW THE LINE             
AT EDITH PIAF.                  

1338
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:29,031
ACTUALLY I'M LAUGHING AT        
THE FACT YOU'RE HERE AGAIN.     

1339
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:33,936
YOU LOG MORE HOURS THAN I DO.   

1340
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:36,372
OH, WELL, I'M GLAD YOU FIND     
MY PAIN AMUSING.                

1341
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:37,673
OH, I DO,                       

1342
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:40,509
AND IF I KNEW YOU BETTER, I     
WOULD TOTALLY MOCK THE BERET.   

1343
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,679
3 WORDS--                       
THEMED BRIDAL SHOWER.           

1344
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,147
OHH!                            

1345
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,683
CAN I HELP YOU OUT              
WITH A SUDDEN DEBILITATING      
BLOW TO THE HEAD?               

1346
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:48,718
THAT'S SO SWEET.                

1347
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,619
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST CHECK       
THE REGISTRY.                   

1348
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:51,687
OH, WAIT, NO!                   

1349
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:52,888
I'M OVER REGISTRIES.            

1350
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:54,323
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST             
NOT FAIR THAT                   

1351
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,825
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE              
GETTING MARRIED                 

1352
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,994
YOU GET TO HAND PEOPLE LISTS    
AND SAY BUY ME THIS STUFF       

1353
00:49:57,996 --> 00:49:59,962
AND NO ONE FINDS THIS           
PRESUMPTUOUS.                   

1354
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:02,732
WHAT? YOU DON'T AGREE?          

1355
00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:04,433
YOU'RE NOT GOING SOFT ON ME,    
ARE YOU?                        

1356
00:50:04,435 --> 00:50:05,634
IT JUST REALLY HARD             
TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY           

1357
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,069
WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE              
A GONDOLIER.                    

1358
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:08,170
HOW IS THIS MY LIFE?            

1359
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:09,638
HEY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE      

1360
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,640
THE "IF YOU CAN'T BEAT 'EM,     
JOIN 'EM" APPROACH.             

1361
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,676
AND WHAT--SHACK UP              
WITH SOME RANDOM GUY            

1362
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:15,311
IN ORDER TO GET PRESENTS?       

1363
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:17,279
   NO, JUST REGISTER YOURSELF   
   FOR LIKE YOUR 30th BIRTHDAY. 

1364
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,614
[SIGHS] OH, RIGHT,              

1365
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:21,017
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
HUMILIATION IN MY LIFE.         

1366
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,685
WELL, THEN BUY YOURSELF         
SOMETHING NICE,                 

1367
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,253
YOU KNOW, TO GET THROUGH        
ALL THIS.                       

1368
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,721
AN ISLAND.                      

1369
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:28,024
           WELL, I WAS THINKING 
           CHAMPAGNE GLASSES.   

1370
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,493
            THEY MAKE           
            A NICE STATEMENT    
            LIKE, YOU KNOW,     

1371
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:34,063
YOU HAVE LOTS OF THINGS         
TO CELEBRATE,                   

1372
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:35,865
YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD            
SALESPERSON.                    

1373
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,500
SHH. KEEP IT DOWN.              

1374
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:39,402
I'M STILL HOPING TO ESCAPE      
THIS PLACE ONE DAY.             

1375
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,275
    I FOR ONE AM SO RELIEVED--  
    OVER A YEAR OF PLANNING!    

1376
00:50:46,277 --> 00:50:48,477
THANK GOD THIS WEDDING          
IS IN 2 WEEKS!                  

1377
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,179
OVER A YEAR OF PLANNING!        

1378
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:51,814
IT'S BEEN MORE LIKE 24 YEARS.   

1379
00:50:51,816 --> 00:50:54,683
YOU USED TO READ ME EXCERPTS    
    FROM<i> MODERN BRIDE.</i>          

1380
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,520
    SO, NATASHA, WE'RE SO GLAD  

1381
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:59,255
    YOU COULD FIT US            
    INTO YOUR GLAMOROUS LIFE.   

1382
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:01,991
    OH, I DON'T KNOW            
    HOW GLAMOROUS IT IS.        

1383
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:04,994
IF I WASN'T HERE, I'D BE SITTING
AT HOME WRITING IN MY PJs.      

1384
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:07,663
    A FAMOUS ACTRESS            
    AND SHE'S MODEST.           

1385
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:10,499
    WELL, I'M JUST SO EXCITED   
    TO BE A PART OF THIS        

1386
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,635
    'CAUSE IT'S NOT EVERY DAY   
    THAT DANA GETS MARRIED,     

1387
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:14,103
AT LEAST WE HOPE.               

1388
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:15,538
HA HA HA!                       
YES, WE DO!                     

1389
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,608
SO, SPEAKING OF WEDDINGS,       
I HEARD ABOUT MAX.              

1390
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,943
MAX FROM...WORK?                

1391
00:51:20,945 --> 00:51:23,279
HE'S JANE'S EX.                 

1392
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,747
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.         

1393
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,182
YEAH, MAX JUST GOT ENGAGED      

1394
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:28,517

AT<i> COSMOPOLITAN SCENE.</i>          

1395
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:31,120
NO, IT'S OK, REALLY.            

1396
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:32,755
[LAUGHS] I WISH HIM THE BEST.   

1397
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:36,559
WELL, IT'S GOOD THAT YOU        
AT LEAST HAVE TIMOTHY.          

1398
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:39,128
AND I FEEL VERY LUCKY           
TO HAVE HIM IN MY LIFE.         

1399
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,030
WELL, GOOD. I LOOK FORWARD      
TO MEETING HIM AT THE WEDDING.  

1400
00:51:41,032 --> 00:51:42,431
THANK YOU.                      

1401
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,567
AND OF COURSE, YOU KNOW,        
IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT,       

1402
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:47,269
            ETHAN MILES         
        IS STILL AVAILABLE.     

1403
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,404
        [LAUGHTER]              

1404
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,605
        RIGHT.                  

1405
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,341
      EXCUSE ME.                
      I'M GONNA GET MORE CREPES.

1406
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:55,711
 REMEMBER, YOU STILL HAVE TO FIT
 INTO YOUR BRIDESMAID DRESS.    

1407
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:05,521
        I'M SO SORRY ABOUT MAX. 

1408
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:07,123
     I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS USED
     TO BE AN ITEM.             

1409
00:52:07,125 --> 00:52:08,891
        WHY DIDN'T TELL ME?     

1410
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:09,859
            OH, I DON'T KNOW.   

1411
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:11,827
            IT'S JUST NOT       
            A VERY BIG DEAL.    

1412
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,864
WELL, I'M AROUND IF YOU EVER    
WANT TO TALK.                   

1413
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:17,600
WOW. THANKS, BUT I'M GOOD.      

1414
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:20,769
SO HOW IS EVERYTHING GOING?     

1415
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:24,006
OK, YOU KNOW, JUST SLOWLY       
GETTING USED TO THE IDEA        

1416
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:25,975
OF BEING PREGNANT AND STUFF.    

1417
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:28,277
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE          
TO TELL MY PARENTS SOMEDAY SOON.

1418
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:29,879
                OH, I'M SURE    
            THEY'LL BE EXCITED. 

1419
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:33,015
       WOULD YOU COME WITH ME...
       NEXT WEEKEND?            

1420
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:33,983
        OH, I DON'T THINK THAT--

1421
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,651
   PLEASE! THIS IS JUST TOO BIG.

1422
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,453
            I DON'T THINK I CAN 
            FACE THEM ALONE.    

1423
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:38,687
            ARE YOU SURE?       

1424
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,490
           YEAH. IT'LL BE GREAT.
           REALLY.              

1425
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:44,860
        THANKS SO MUCH BECAUSE  
        I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
        WITHOUT YOU.            

1426
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,295
            NATASHA, COME ON.   

1427
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:49,231
      THINGS HAVE BEEN SO BORING
      WITHOUT YOU.              

1428
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:50,733
        OH, STOP!               

1429
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:54,270
I DON'T KNOW.                   

1430
00:52:54,272 --> 00:52:56,805
WHAT DO YOU THINK--             
TOO LOW CUT?                    

1431
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:58,374
HON, YOU SAW<i> GREASE</i>             
 LIKE 14 TIMES AS A KID.        

1432
00:52:58,376 --> 00:52:59,708
HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE GOTTEN   
ITS MESSAGE?                    

1433
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:02,244
SO, DID YOU SEE WHAT            
TIMOTHY SENT ME?                

1434
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:04,513
I ASSUME THEY WEREN'T THIS      
PATHETIC WHEN HE SENT THEM.     

1435
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:07,082
NO, THEY WERE BEAUTIFUL.        

1436
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:08,350
SO, HAVE YOU TALKED?            

1437
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,752
NO, HE LEFT A MESSAGE.          

1438
00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:11,320
BUT HAVE YOU TALKED?            

1439
00:53:11,322 --> 00:53:13,956
HE LEFT A MESSAGE.              
                UH-HUH.         

1440
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,124
              DON'T "UH-HUH" ME.

1441
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:16,325
              YOU KNOW HE'S BUSY
              AT THE HOSPITAL.  

1442
00:53:16,327 --> 00:53:17,660
                  TOO BUSY      
             FOR A CONVERSATION?

1443
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:20,162
YES, AND DON'T ACT LIKE         
THAT'S SOMETHING WEIRD.         

1444
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:21,363
DOCTOR'S HAVE                   
INSANE SCHEDULES.               

1445
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,798
YOU'VE SEEN<i> ER.</i>                 

1446
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,433
I GUESS, BUT I'M GLAD WE'RE     
GOING OUT TONIGHT.              

1447
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:25,534
NEVER HURTS TO HAVE BACKUPS.    

1448
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,136
I DON'T NEED A BACKUP.          

1449
00:53:27,138 --> 00:53:28,337

00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,139
              JANE, IT'S SO NICE
              TO SEE YOU.       

1564
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:39,007
 MY GOODNESS, YOU LOOK JUST LIKE
 YOUR MOTHER,                   

1565
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:40,042
          MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.

1566
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,543
                PLEASE, COME IN.
                COME IN.        

1567
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,196
         CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

1568
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:02,531
         SOME ICED TEA, PERHAPS?

1569
01:00:02,533 --> 01:00:04,299
            MMM. NO THANKS.     

1570
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,434
WHERE'S DADDY?                  

1571
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:06,468
HE HAD TO GO OUT                
FOR A WHILE.                    

1572
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,803
HE SHOULD BE BACK SOON.         

1573
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:10,606
SO, JANE, I UNDERSTAND YOUR     
COUSIN DANA IS GETTING MARRIED. 

1574
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,774
YES, NEXT WEEK                  
AT THE CARLTON.                 

1575
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:13,875
OH, THE CARLTON.                

1576
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,377
WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY            
WHAT SHE DESERVES.              

1577
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,145
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN               
SUCH A NICE GIRL.               

1578
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:20,048
YEAH. WELL, I MEAN,             
YOU MUST BE SO PROUD OF NATASHA.

1579
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,150
SHE'S A TERRIFIC ACTRESS,       

1580
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:24,319
AND AS IT TURNS OUT,            
A WONDERFUL WRITER, TOO.        

1581
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,488
WELL, I UNDERSTAND              
YOU'RE THE EDITOR OF THE BOOK.  

1582
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,391
I'M SURE HAVING A GOOD EDITOR   
IS CRUCIAL TO SUCCESS.          

1583
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:31,259
DADDY'S NOT COMING BACK,        
IS HE?                          

1584
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:33,228
I ASSUME HE'LL BE BACK          
AT SOME POINT.                  

1585
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,063
BUT NOT UNTIL I LEAVE,          
RIGHT?                          

1586
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:38,500
NATASHA, DON'T ACT LIKE         
THIS IS YOUR FATHER'S FAULT.    

1587
01:00:38,502 --> 01:00:39,601
YOU MADE YOUR CHOICES.          

1588
01:00:39,603 --> 01:00:41,570
YOU HAVE TO LIVE                
WITH THE CONSEQUENCES.          

1589
01:00:41,572 --> 01:00:45,040
        WELL, UM,               
        IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE   
        SOME EXCITING NEWS,     

1590
01:00:45,042 --> 01:00:46,742
AND I HAD HOPED                 
TO TELL YOU BOTH.               

1591
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:49,211
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,           
I CAN TELL HIM.                 

1592
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:55,217
OK, UM, YOU'RE                  
GOING TO BE GRANDPARENTS.       

1593
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:57,352
I'M PREGNANT.                   

1594
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,121
DO YOU KNOW                     
WHO THE FATHER IS?              

1595
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:02,057
          YES, I DO.            
          IT'S SAM.             

1596
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,792
OH, WELL, I DIDN'T WANT         
TO ASSUME.                      

1597
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:05,160
YOU NEVER KNOW WITH YOU.        

1598
01:01:07,097 --> 01:01:10,365
       [SOBBING] YOU KNOW WHAT, 
       I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.   

1599
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:14,002
I KNOW WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT    
I AM TO YOU,                    

1600
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:18,273
AND YOU CAN TELL DADDY          
I'M SORRY FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE.

1601
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:23,178
OK, LET'S GO.                   

1602
01:01:29,553 --> 01:01:33,155
HEY, THEY DIDN'T                
HAVE DIET. SORRY.               

1603
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:35,791
WHATEVER.                       

1604
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:38,493
NATASHA, I'M SORRY,             
BUT YOUR PARENTS ARE WRONG.     

1605
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:40,429
IT'S CRAZY                      
THAT THEY CAN'T SEE             

1606
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,230
HOW MUCH                        
YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED.            

1607
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,565
LIKE WHAT?                      

1608
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:46,835
DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE         
TO BECOME AN ACTRESS,           

1609
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,503
GOING INTO REHAB,               

1610
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:50,505
HAVING A RIDICULOUS AFFAIR      

1611
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,641
AND THEN GOSSIPING ABOUT IT     
IN THE TABLOIDS.                

1612
01:01:52,643 --> 01:01:55,811
YEAH, BUT YOU'VE GOTTEN         
THROUGH ALL THOSE THINGS.       

1613
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:58,847
YOU'VE TURNED EVERY PROBLEM     
INTO A POSITIVE.                

1614
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:00,015
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.              

1615
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:03,518
NO, YOU'RE THE ONE              
WITH THE IMPRESSIVE LIFE.       

1616
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,487
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN                
JEALOUS OF YOU.                 

1617
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:06,488
WHAT?                           

1618
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,056
[LAUGHING] I MEAN IT.           

1619
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,726
YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN             
HOW TO GET WHAT YOU WANT,       

1620
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:14,162
LIKE WHEN WE RAN                
AGAINST EACH OTHER              

1621
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,964
YOU GAVE THIS GREAT SPEECH      

1622
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:18,433
ABOUT WHAT YOU                  
HOPED TO ACCOMPLISH,            

1623
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:20,268
HAD THOSE CUTE                  
LITTLE BUTTONS                  

1624
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,803
MADE IN THE SHAPE               
OF BAND-AIDS                    

1625
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,839
THAT SAID "AVOID PAIN...        

1626
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:26,408
Both: VOTE FOR JANE."           
[LAUGHING]                      

1627
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:28,477
AND I WORE A HALTER TOP.        

1628
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:29,578
AND YOU WON.                    

1629
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,079
BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE.           

1630
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,548
YOU'VE GOT                      
GREAT FRIENDS,                  

1631
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,184
AND A FAMILY                    
WHO LOVES YOU.                  

1632
01:02:36,186 --> 01:02:37,819
AND YOU'RE                      
AN EXECUTIVE EDITOR.            

1633
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:39,788
I MEAN, YOU'VE WORKED           
REALLY HARD FOR THAT.           

1634
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:42,491
I ADMIRE THAT.                  

1635
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:43,859
THANK YOU.                      

1636
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:47,696
UM, IT'S NOT                    
ENTIRELY TRUE, THOUGH.          

1637
01:02:47,698 --> 01:02:49,397
IT'S NOT?                       

1638
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:50,766
NO.                             

1639
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:52,934
I'M AN ASSISTANT EDITOR.        

1640
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,871
EXECUTIVE EDITOR                
ISN'T EVEN A REAL TITLE.        

1641
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:58,140
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU            
TELL ME THIS BEFORE?            

1642
01:02:58,142 --> 01:03:00,008
WELL, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT        
THE ONLY ONE                    

1643
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,477
THAT'S SPENT A LONG TIME        
THINKING SOME ELSE'S LIFE       

1644
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,246
WAS MORE IMPRESSIVE             
THAN THEIR OWN.                 

1645
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:05,413
HMM.                            

1646
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:07,349
HUH.                            

1647
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:10,252
HEY, YOU'RE SEEING<i> HAIRSPRAY</i>    
 TONIGHT. WE SHOULD GO.         

1648
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:21,997
YOU KNOW WHAT,                  
I'M GOOD HERE.                  

1649
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,799
HEY, I HAVEN'T                  
SEEN YOU ALL DAY.               

1650
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:24,933
I'M GIVING THE FIRST            
2 CHAPTERS                      

1651
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:26,601
OF NATASHA'S BOOK               
TO REMKE                        

1652
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:27,969
AND I WANT THEM                 
TO BE PERFECT.                  

1653
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:29,371
THAT'S WEIRD.                   

1654
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:31,206
WHAT?                           
I NEVER HEARD YOU               
CALL HER NATASHA.               

1655
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:32,374
HUH.                            

1656
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:34,209
ALL RIGHT. WELL,                
DON'T STAY TOO LATE.            

1657
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:36,077
YOU'VE GOT THE BACHELORETTE     
PARTY, RIGHT?                   
YEAH.                           

1658
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,679
TRY NOT TO LET DANA             
GET TOO CRAZY.                  

1659
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,981
I DON'T THINK                   
THAT'LL BE A PROBLEM.           

1660
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:42,450
OH, JANE.                       
I'M SORRY.                      

1661
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:43,985
WELL, HI.                       

1662
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,921
I'M GLAD YOU COULD SQUEEZE US   
INTO YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE.        

1663
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:47,189
YEAH, I WAS TRYING              
TO GET AHEAD                    

1664
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,590
SO I DON'T HAVE TO WORK         
THIS WEEKEND.                   

1665
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:49,758
ALL RIGHT.                      

1666
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,126
WELL, I'D                       
CERTAINLY HOPE                  

1667
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:52,761
YOU WEREN'T THINKING            
ABOUT WORK AT MY WEDDING.       

1668
01:03:52,763 --> 01:03:53,728
YES. YES.                       

1669
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,430
COME ON. GO HERE.               

1670
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:58,233
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR TOES AND 
YOUR FINGERS DONE, ALL RIGHT?   

1671
01:03:58,235 --> 01:03:59,434
OH, GREAT.                      
OK.                             

1672
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:02,270
ALL RIGHT, UH,                  
I BROUGHT MY OWN POLISH.        

1673
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:04,539

THE CHAMPAGNE DRESSES.          

1675
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,475
IT'S LIKE A BELLINI.

ON OUR TOES, TOO.               

1678

BUT WE'RE                       
WEARING PUMPS.                  

1679
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,652
OUR TOES ARE                    
GONNA BE COVERED.               

1680
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:20,522
BUT WE'RE ALL GETTING PRECIOUS  
PEACH ON OUR TOES, TOO!         

1681
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:23,525

DON'T BE SO DIFFICULT.          

1682
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:24,659
AM I CRAZY?                     

1683
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,428
I MEAN HOW COULD IT             
POSSIBLY MATTER                 

1684
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:29,064
WHAT COLOR IS ON OUR TOES       
IF THEY'RE COVERED?             

1685
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:30,765
        HONEY, THIS IS          
        DANA'S WEDDING.

DANA WANTS PRECIOUS PEACH.      

1687
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:34,102
NOW WHEN YOU GET MARRIED,       

1688
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,504
YOU CAN DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT,   
ALL RIGHT?                      

1689
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:39,407
                    FINE.       

1690
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:43,879
    SO, JANE, I CAN'T BELIEVE   
    I'M FINALLY GONNA MEET      

1691
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:46,615
        THE MYSTERIOUS          
        TIMOTHY ROMMELLY.       

1692
01:04:46,617 --> 01:04:50,385
YEAH. THE THING IS,             
HE'S ON CALL.                   

1693
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:51,453
HE'S NOT COMING?                

1694
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:53,455
NO, I'M REALLY SORRY.           

1695
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:55,690
I CAN'T BELIEVE                 
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME SOONER.      

1696
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:56,858
            THIS CERTAINLY      
        WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED  

1697
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,894
        IF YOU HAD CHOSEN ETHAN.

1698
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:01,229
        WHY WOULD YOU RSVP      
        FOR 2 PEOPLE            

1699
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,431
   IF THERE WAS CHANCE          
   ONE OF THEM WOULDN'T MAKE IT.

1700
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:06,935
        THAT'S $225             
        WE CAN'T GET BACK!      

1701
01:05:06,937 --> 01:05:09,204
        I...TOLD YOU            
        AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT. 

1702
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:10,739
        OH, REALLY?             

1703
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:13,008
   WELL, I WOULD SAY THE CHANCES
   WERE PRETTY GOOD             

1704
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,277
      THAT "TIMOTHY" WASN'T EVER
      GOING TO MAKE IT!         

1705
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:17,279
        I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU    
        JUST DIDN'T GO ALONE!   

1706
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:19,247
        YOU KNOW, DANA,         
        THAT'S FUNNY.           

1707
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,317
        OR SHOULD I SAY "FUNNY" 
        BECAUSE IT'S REALLY NOT.

1708
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,719
        JANE, I THINK YOU NEED  
        TO CALM DOWN HERE.      

1709
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,821
       NO, I AM SO SICK OF THIS!

1710
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:28,523
        YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT! 

1711
01:05:28,525 --> 01:05:31,293
        TIMOTHY IS NOT ON CALL  
        OR MAYBE HE IS,         

1712
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:33,228
    BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW BECAUSE,

1713
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:37,165
   ALTHOUGH HE IS NOT IMAGINARY,
   HE IS ALSO NOT MY BOYFRIEND! 

1714
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,900
        I PRETENDED HE WAS!     

1715
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:42,103
  YOU KNOW, I SOMEHOW LET MYSELF
  BE CONVINCED                  

1716
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:46,274
    THAT A WOMAN IS NOT NORMAL  
    UNLESS SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND, 

1717
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,176
        BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?      
        I AM NORMAL!            

1718
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,345
AT LEAST I AM                   
THE SAME AMOUNT OF NORMAL       

1719
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:51,713
AS I WOULD BE WITH A BOYFRIEND, 

1720
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:53,682
    AND YOU KNOW WHAT--         
        [SOBBING]               

1721
01:05:53,684 --> 01:05:56,851
THE POINT IS IT'S NOT EVEN      
ABOUT THE BOYFRIEND!            

1722
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:59,454
I HAVE A REALLY GOOD LIFE!      

1723
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:02,123
I HAVE A LIFE THAT IS           
FULL OF MORE MEANINGFUL THINGS  

1724
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:05,727
THAN DEPLETING THE WORLD        
OF THE COLOR PRECIOUS PEACH!    

1725
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:08,797
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYONE    
MAKE LESS OF MY LIFE            

1726
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,199
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE            
A BOYFRIEND!                    

1727
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:23,445
WELL, NO WONDER SHE DOESN'T     
HAVE A BOYFRIEND!               

1728
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:32,153
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?           

1729
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:34,422
I GAVE REMKE THE PARTIALS       
FOR NATASHA'S BOOK,             

1730
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,324
I NEED TO THINK                 
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.            

1731
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,226
            DRISCOLL MEYER      
            IS BADMOUTHING YOU  
            ALL OVER TOWN.      

1732
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:40,228
WHAT? I CALLED 20 DIFFERENT     
MEYERS IN MANHATTAN.            

1733
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,097
    IS IT MY FAULT              
    HE'S NOT LISTED?            

1734
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:44,099
        YEAH, WELL, APPARENTLY, 
    HE WENT TO<i> HAIRSPRAY</i> ALONE. 

1735
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:45,800
HARVEY FIERSTEIN HIT ON HIM     
AFTER THE SHOW.                 

1736
01:06:45,802 --> 01:06:49,771
OHH! YIKES! TELL HIM            
I'LL PAY FOR HIS THERAPY.       

1737
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:54,376
WILLIAM WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU   
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM...NOW.   

1738
01:06:54,378 --> 01:06:57,946
OK, I HAVE TO GO.               
TELL ME NOT TO THROW UP.        

1739
