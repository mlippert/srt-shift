would you, please?              

475
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:46,570
                          - Yup.

476
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:48,239
          - [groaning]          
         - Here, here.          

477
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,041
                   - Okay, good.
                      remove it.

478
00:21:50,043 --> 00:21:51,042
        - How bad is it?        

479
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,010
- Uh, it's bad.                 

480
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:56,080
   It's bad, there's quite a few
  pieces of shrapnel inside you,

481
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:57,114
        if they'reot removedimm.

483
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,117
   - Guys, we have to get her   
         to a hospital.         

484
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,218
       - We can't, they're gonna
               ID her as a meta.

485
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,787
- And not just any meta.        

486
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,555
        - Yeah, one that we have
   a file on for attacking CCPD.

487
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,390
- Then what are we going to do? 
     None of us are doctors     

488
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,459
     and she can't operate      
          on herself.           

489
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,960

- She can generate?             

494
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:19,136
     - No, we're not gonna      
     take off my necklace.

          You were a field medic
       in the Royal Army, right?

497
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:26,143
   - What? No, I-I-I've never   
   operated on anyone before.   

498
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,778
                  - That's okay,
       I'll walk you through it.

503
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:45,329
        - What the hell were you
                       thinking?

504
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,931
- Now is not the time,          
Gypsy.                          

505
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:51,569
    - You know, you got a really
      messed up sense of justice

506
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:52,570
- Watch yoself.                 

507
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:55,206
I took two oaths                
in my life.                     

508
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,342
One, to uphold the law.         
The other, to protect my family.

509
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,810
Guess which one                 
takes priority?                 

510
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,579
         That was mprisoner.    

511
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,514
- He was my prisoner too,       
and you're on my Earth.         

512
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:06,450
He has information that could   
save Iris's life,               

513
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,185
so I don't give a damn!         

514
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,820
It's bause of yohe'sn thloos    

515
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:14,558
- Because of me?                
No, no, because of you.         

516
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,861
That is on you,                 
Detective!                      

517
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,201
How much of that                
did you hear?                   

518
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,569
               - I heard enough.

519
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:26,904
              This is my friend.

520
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,006
It's the man's daughter.        

521
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,875
I mean, wodn't you do that      
    for somee you careabout?    

522
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,543
- I am doing that,              
you idiot!                      

523
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,311
    - Okay, what does that mean?

524
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:36,547
                        For who?
      Who are you talking about?

525
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:39,183
- I used to have                
a partner.                      

526
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:44,121
             - Like, a “partne”"
            or...like a partner?

527
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,023
- Both.                         

528
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,859
It w a long ti ago,             
Cisco.                          

529
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:50,528
It's not like I'm burning       
a candle for the guy,           

530
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,131
but he did mean                 
something to me.                

531
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:57,067
It's been three years since     
Abra Kadabra shot him dead.     

532
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,237
                    - I'm sorry.

533
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,306
- I have been searching         
for him ever since,             

534
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:05,242
and he finally                  
showed back up.                 

535
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,211
Ten minutes ago,                
I had him dead to rights,       

536
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,480
and then your friend            
messed it all up.               

537
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,048
So yes, I do know               
what it is lik                  

538
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,984
to care about someone so much   
that you break the rules.       

539
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:16,987
That's why I have to find       
this guy, no matter what,       

540
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:20,357
and when I do,                  
he is gonna pay for what he did.

541
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:24,195
                 No me delays.  

542
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,201
            - Ready?            
    - Ready as I'll ever be.    

543
00:24:30,203 --> 00:24:31,602
      - Okay, let's starst      
       with the shrapnel        

544
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:32,736
        on the surface.         

545
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,438
                   - Okey-dokey.

546
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,539
      - [inhales sharply]       
   - Just let me kn if I do     

547
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,142

                           okay?

548
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,510
           - [groans]

00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,781
   - Okay, that's the first bit.
                      Well done.

551
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,183
                        Okay.   

552
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,520
    Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.       
      - [inhales sharply]       

553
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,055
- Is there supposed to be       
this much blood?                

554
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:55,392

557
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,697
      - [inhales sharply]       
         - Oh, my God.          

558
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,265
                         - Okay.

559
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:02,733
      - [inhales sharply]

     from the surface gone.     

564
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,674
         - Okay, great.         
Now it's time for the ha one.   

565
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,876
    But you're doing great.     

566
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,677
  You got this, okay, Julian?   
             - Yes.             

567
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,115
- It's wedged between my kney   
   anmy inferior vena cava,     

568
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:22,653
      and it's surrounded       
  by some major blood vessels.  

569
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,788
      I'll go into shock.       
            - Shock?            

570
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,591
        - But it's okay.        
        You've got this.        

571
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,326

576
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,166

          it's stuck.           

577
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:38,168

a tendon in the way.]           

580
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:41,739
        - If it's not a tendon--

581
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,674
- Then I will rip               
this necklace off.              

582
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:45,943
             - No!              
      I would rather die.       

583
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:49,413
              - Caitlin, this is
                  going to hurt.

584
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,817

 Ahh.                           
             - Ohh!             

586
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,688

          to pass out?          

589
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,293
                     - Ye yes.
